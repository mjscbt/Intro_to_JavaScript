/*
 * Programming Quiz: Musical Groups (3-3)
 *
 * Directions:
 * Write a series of conditional statements that:
 *
 * - prints "not a group" if musicians is less than or equal to 0
 * - prints "solo" if musicians is equal to 1
 * - prints "duet" if musicians is equal to 2
 * - prints "trio" if musicians is equal to 3
 * - prints "quartet" if musicians is equal to 4
 * - prints "this is a large group" if musicians is greater than 4
 *
 * TIP: Make sure to test your code with different values. For example,
 *
 * If musicians equals 3, then trio should be printed to the console.
 * If musicians equals 20, then this is a large group should be printed to the console.
 * If musicians equals -1, then not a group should be printed to the console.
